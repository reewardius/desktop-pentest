| 1.1  | DESKTOP-1-L2-QAS | Verify that every endpoint underwent testing using the Web Security Checklist.                          |        | Critical |
| 1.2  | DESKTOP-2-L2-QAS | Ensure the application neither stores nor exposes secrets in configuration files, logs, memory, registry, during installation, update or uninstallation. |        | High     |
| 1.3  | DESKTOP-3-L2-AS  | Ensure that all DLL files are signed to prevent DLL Hijacking attacks and safeguard against any potential tampering by users within the DLL library. |        | High     |
| 1.4  | DESKTOP-4-L1-QA  | Ensure all data (including during installation, update and delete) is transmitted through secure communication channels. |        | High     |
| 1.5  | DESKTOP-5-L2-QAS | Ensure that the program installer has a digital signature.                                                |        | Medium   |
| 1.6  | DESKTOP-6-L1-QAS | Ensure there are no weak file/folder permissions according to user role, there is a principle of least privilege (applies if the user has no admin privileges on the system). |        | Medium   |
| 1.7  | DESKTOP-7-L1-QA  | Ensure that sensitive information like passwords, tokens, credit cards, etc., is not fully displayed in the UI. |        | Medium   |
| 1.8  | DESKTOP-8-L2-AS  | Ensure sensitive data stored (local data caching) is properly encrypted or anonymized, preventing unauthorized access even if someone gains control of the workstation. |        | Medium   |
| 1.9  | DESKTOP-9-L2-AS  | Ensure that Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP) are enabled for the program files. |        | Low      |
| 1.10 | DESKTOP-10-L1-QAS| Ensure that upon uninstallation of an application, all associated data (files/services/certificates/firewall rules/registry entries) is completely removed from the system. |        | Low      |
| 1.11 | DESKTOP-11-L2-QAS| Ensure that program code is obfuscated and obfuscation prevents unauthorized parties from accessing the application logic and source code. |        | Low      |
